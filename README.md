Entity Framework
===
Entity Framework is Microsoft's recommended data access technology for new applications in .NET. 

Entity Framework 7 provides a familiar developer experience including LINQ, POCO and Code First support yet enableS access to data across relational and not relational stores, is much more lightweight than previous versions and is built from the ground up to work great in cloud (using ASP.NET vNext) and devices (i.e. in universal Windows apps) as well as in traditional .NET scenarios. 

This project is part of ASP.NET vNext. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET vNext at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.
