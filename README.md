Entity Framework
===
Entity Framework is Microsoft's recommended data access technology for new applications in .NET. 

Entity Framework 7 (EF7) provides a familiar developer experience including LINQ, POCO and Code First support yet enables access to data across relational and not relational stores. EF7 is much more lightweight than previous versions and is built from the ground up to work great in the cloud (using ASP.NET vNext) on devices (i.e. in universal Windows apps) as well as in traditional .NET scenarios. 

For code that demonstrates using EF7 to access SQL Server, see the [Data.SqlServer sample](https://github.com/aspnet/Entropy/blob/dev/samples/Data.SqlServer/Program.cs).

This project is part of ASP.NET vNext. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET vNext at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.
